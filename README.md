# Transparent image demonstration

This project is a simple demonstration of image transparency under Windows although some programming techniques employed here 
apply to any operating system (e.g. pixel manipulation by using pointer arithmetics). In addition to image transparency, it can also do color to greyscale conversion. The application demonstrates the following

  - transparency of bitmap (it supports 8/15/16 and 24 bit bitmaps) or jpeg images
  - transparency of Windows region objects including rectangles, round rectangles and ellipses
  - allows different glass colors to be used as transparency masks
  - allows different transparency levels from completely transparent to completely opaque
  - conversion of color images to greyscale ones
  
The program can be compiled using Borland C++ Builder. If you just want to see what it does without compiling it, take a
look at the screenshots provided in the images folder.
