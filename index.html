<h1>Transparent image demonstration</h1>
<p> 
This project is a simple demonstration of image transparency under Windows although some programming techniques employed here 
apply to any operating system (e.g. pixel manipulation by using pointer arithmetics). The program demonstrates the following
</p>
<ul>
<li>transparency of bitmap (it supports 8/15/16 and 24 bit bitmaps) or jpeg images</li>
<li>transparency of Windows region objects including rectangles, round rectangles and ellipses</li>
<li>allows different glass colors</li>
<li>allows different transparency levels from completely transparent to completely opaque</li>
<li>conversion of color images to greyscale ones</li>
</ul>

<p>
Below are several screenshots of the program, which should be enough to understand what the application does.
